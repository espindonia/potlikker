                    <h3>The Food of the American South</h3>
                    <p>Southern cuisine is wide and varied, as described in the book. Each region in the South has its own local specialties, influenced by the history of the people who settled there.</p>
                    <p>Edge claims, on one hand, that there is no Southern cuisine without Black cuisine. Many Southern specialties, from okra and potlikker to KFC and Popeyie's, were heavily influenced (or originated from) the African American community, many of which had origins from the time of slavery.</p>
                    <p>Potlikker, as a title example, became popular due to its necessity during slavery. White slave owners would makes soups and stews using various vegetables, and would leave the broth for the slaves, as they believed it to be waste. In reality, it was more nutritional than the cooked vegetables the slave owners ate, and was fundamental in nourishing slaves in their limited diets.</p>
                    <p>Alcohol, too, has played a large part in the culture of the American south. Moonshine, brandy, vodka and soda, bourbun, whiskey, all have been popular, though which a person drank depended in part on their economic class. Moonshine in particular was popular with the poor Southerners, made from leftover grain (corn) to prevent waste.</p>
