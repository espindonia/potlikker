                    <p><b><i>The Potlikker Papers</i></b> is a book about the history of food in the American South, namely for the African American community. It discusses topics like identity, societal movements, and racial inequality and how that influenced the diet of Southerners. The book reviews the stories of many figures important to both the Civil Rights movement, and to the development of what we consider today to be typical Southern cuisine, covering many events from the 1950s up into the present day. It was published in 2017, and is available as a physical book, ebook, and audio book.</p>
