                    <h3>Southern History</h3>
                    <p>Southern history is as diverse as the people who live here. That being said, <i>The Potlikker Papers</i> specifically talks about how slavery, the fight for equality, and a revival of Southern heritage, culture, and cuisine have influenced the food of the South.</p>
                    <p>Slavery is one of many stains on the tapestry that is Southern history, and is an incredibly important time for any American citizen to learn about. It continues to have lasting effects on society, and racial inequality is an issue that is still seen to this day in our society.</p>
